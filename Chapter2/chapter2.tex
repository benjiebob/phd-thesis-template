% Awf: Do you really think it's a good idea to go into e.g. normalizing flows which are only relevant in the final chapter? It will make those final chapters quite short otherwise. Look at Kendall's thesis: file:///C:/Users/bjb10042/Downloads/thesis.pdf#page=27&zoom=100,116,581

% Awf: I wanted to do some toy experiments to help explain the effect of e.g. silhouette loss. Does that belong in this related work section?
