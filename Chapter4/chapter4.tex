% Plan:
% - Introduction - complain about the non-automatic equivalent systems & lack of training data for animals. Impractical to obtain. 
% - Begin with a discussion on systems that use synthetic data for training. Related work should focus on these
% - Discuss methods for generating accurate synthetic data, particularly focus on SURREAL. 
% - Create experiments in which different methods are trained and tested on varying levels of fake data.
% - In-depth explanation of synthetic data creation
% - In-depth explanation of training the joint predictor. Possibly ablate the sampling strategy / architecture. Diagrams etc.
% - Explain why we need to fix with a QP/GA.
% - In depth formulation of the QP and show it works, then explain the GA.
% - Experimental evaluation -- in depth explanation about the data collection exercise etc.
% - Experimental comparison between the two methods
% - In-depth explantion of the SMAL optimizer.
% - Results and comparison to related work
% - Summary 

% Extra experiments: 
% (1) Show that training on synthetic real data doesn't work (e.g. fake textures).
% (2) Use a GAN to generate synthetic data? Why not? Articulated sections didn't work.
