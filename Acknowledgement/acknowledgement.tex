This thesis memoralizes some of best years of my life, which I am privileged to have spent with many truely inspirational individuals. I am grateful to my wonderful supervisors Andrew Fitzgibbon and Roberto Cipolla. Over the course of my PhD, they have provided a grounding in the field of computer vision, priceless strategic advice, helped dissect theories and critiqued countless paper drafts and presentation materials. I am particularly grateful for their determination to make time for me around their impossibly busy schedules, perhaps for a technical discussion or even a rallying coffee after a disappointing paper review. I am hugely indebeted to them both for transforming me from a terrified undergraduate to something approaching a competant academic.

I would like to thank Patrick Hyett and Julie Huxley-Jones, my line manager and project sponsor at GlaxoSmithKline. Much of my career I owe to Patrick's belief in me since he handed me my first computer vision project. I am grateful to Patrick and Julie for their commitment to in-house designed innovation projects which continue to tranform the pharmaceutical industry. I'd also like to my graditude to Andrea Vedaldi and David Novotny who acted as my internship supervisors at Facebook AI Research.  

As I was wisely informed on my first day at PhD, ``water cooler'' discussions between lab mates are a plentiful source of research ideas and fact-checking theories. I would like to thank Cambridge academic staff Richard Turner, Joan Lazenby, Michael Sutcliffe and Matthew Allen, post doctoral colleagues Ignas Budvytis and James Charles, alongside fellow PhD students Oliver Boyne, James Charles and Fotios Logothetis and Sebastien Ehrhardt. 

Of course, modern day deep learning requires passionate support from infrastructure colleagues. I would like to thank Cambridge colleagues Peter Grandi and Raf Czlonka and Kim Branson, Craig Kapfer and John Hanks at GlaxoSmithKline for kindly permitting the use of their resources. 

And finally, I would like to extend a massive thank you to my family and friends. Firstly, an enormous thanks to Thomas Roddick who helped me accalimize to Cambridge life ("So Tom\dots what \emph{is} a formal?") and has always been on hand for a crazy theory over a pint. Put simply, Tom has been the best lab mate anyone could wish for. I'd also like to thank my partner Philippa Liggins, for providing necessary distractions and her diligent proof reading. And of course, I'd like to thank my dear family: Nick, Jackie, Sam and Adam Biggs for their unwaveringly warm support and contribution of paper title puns.

However, I am most grateful to them for their determination to make time for me outside of their impossibly busy schedules, even if only for a rallying coffee after a disappointing conference review. I am hugely indebted to both Andrew and Roberto and hope to find further excuses to work together in the future. Also of this category, I'd like to thank David Novotny and Andrea Vedaldi for supervising work related to ambiguous reconstruction while I was on internship at Facebook AI Research.
