This thesis memorializes some of best years of my life, which I am privileged to have spent with truly inspirational individuals. I am grateful to my wonderful supervisors Andrew Fitzgibbon and Roberto Cipolla. Over the course of my PhD, they have provided a grounding in the field of computer vision, imparted priceless strategic advice, helped dissect theories and critiqued countless paper drafts and presentation materials. I am particularly grateful for their determination to make time for me around their impossibly busy schedules, perhaps for a technical discussion or even a rallying coffee after a disappointing paper review. I am hugely indebted to them both for transforming me from a terrified undergraduate to something approaching a competent academic. Thanks also to my excellent internship supervisors Andrea Vedaldi and David Novotny at Facebook AI Research for supporting work in~\Cref{chap:3dmulti}.

I would like to thank my line manager Patrick Hyett and project sponsor Julie Huxley-Jones at GlaxoSmithKline. Since joining Patrick's team, aged nineteen, his continued continued belief in my ability has shaped much of my career. I am grateful to Patrick and Julie for their commitment to in-house designed innovation projects which continue to transform the pharmaceutical industry. In addition, I'd like to thank Brian Berridge, John Baldoni, Margaret Landi and Sue Sparrow for supporting the funding application for this work.

As I was wisely informed on my first day at PhD, ``water cooler'' discussions between lab mates are a plentiful source of research ideas and fact-checking theories. I would like to thank Cambridge academics Richard Turner, Joan Lazenby, Michael Sutcliffe and Matthew Allen, post doctoral colleagues Ignas Budvytis and James Charles, and fellow PhD students Oliver Boyne, James Charles and Fotios Logothetis and Sebastien Ehrhardt. Also thanks to Peter Fisher, Joanna Moore, Matthew L'Affineur, Kevin Humphries, Sean Maguire and Erica Watson for useful technical discussions. 

Thanks also to my passionate infrastructure colleagues, including Peter Grandi and Raf Czlonka at Cambridge, and Kim Branson, Craig Kapfer and John Hanks at GlaxoSmithKline who kindly permitted use of their resources.

And finally, I would like to extend a massive thank you to my family and friends. Firstly, an enormous thanks to Thomas Roddick for helping me acclimatize to Cambridge life ("So Tom\dots what \emph{is} a formal?"), has always been on hand for a theory over a pint, and is truly the best lab mate one could wish for. Thanks to my partner Philippa Liggins, for providing necessary distractions and her diligent proof reading. And finally, I'd like to thank my dear family, Nick, Jackie, Sam and Adam Biggs for their warm support and consultancy over paper title puns.

However, I am most grateful to them for their determination to make time for me outside of their impossibly busy schedules, even if only for a rallying coffee after a disappointing conference review. I am hugely indebted to both Andrew and Roberto and hope to find further excuses to work together in the future. Also of this category, I'd like to thank David Novotny and Andrea Vedaldi for supervising work related to ambiguous reconstruction while I was on internship at Facebook AI Research.
