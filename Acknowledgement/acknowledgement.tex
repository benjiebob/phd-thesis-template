This thesis memoralizes some of best years of my life, spent in the company of truely inspirational individuals. I am foremost grateful to my wonderful supervisors Andrew Fitzgibbon and Roberto Cipolla, who have been instrumental in providing me with the necessary tools to develop from a terrified undergraduate to something approaching a competant academic. 
%I am most grateful to them both for their insistence that all ideas, machine learning or otherwise, should be firmly rooted and expressed mathematical. 
Both have provided me with priceless strategic advice, dissected theories and critqued my papers and presentation materials. However, I am most grateful to them for their determination to make time for me outside of their impossibly busy schedules, even if only for a rallying coffee after a disappointing conference review. I am hugely indebted to both Andrew and Roberto and hope to find further excuses to work together in the future. Also of this category, I'd like to thank David Novotny and Andrea Vedaldi for supervising work related to ambiguous reconstruction while I was on internship at Facebook AI Research.

I would like to thank Patrick Hyett and Julie Huxley-Jones, who have acted as my PhD project sponsors at GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). I will always been indebeted to Patrick, who saw enough potential in me, aged nineteen during my GSK internship, to offer me my first computer vision project. Since then, Patrick has been inspirational in his commitment to in-house innovation within the pharmaceutical industry I am ever grateful for his support throughout my career.

As I was wisely informed on my first day at PhD, the `water cooler discussions' with lab mates form a great breeding ground for concepts and ideas. For this, I am greatly indebeted to academic staff Richard Turner, Joan Lazenby, Michael Sutcliffe and Matthew Allen, post doctoral colleagues Ignas Budvytis and James Charles, alongside fellow PhD students Oliver Boyne, James Charles and Fotios Logothetis and Sebastien Ehrhardt for vital technical discussions.

Of course, deep learning experiments require the empassioned support of my infrastructure colleagues. For this, I would like to thank Peter Grandi and Raf Czlonka at Cambridge and Craig Kapfer, John Hanks at GSK. Also thanks to Kim Branson who kindly permitted the use of these resources.

And last but not least, I would like to thank Thomas Roddick who apart from accalimizing me to Cambridge life, co-authoring a paper or two and accompayning me on post-submission pub trips is one of the kindest and brightest people I have ever met, and simply put, is the best lab mate anyone could wish for. I'd also like to thank my partner Philippa Liggins who has done her fair share of proof reading, and my dear family Nicholas, Jackie, Sam and Adam Biggs for their warm support and specialized consultancy of paper title puns.
