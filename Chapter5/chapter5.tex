% Plan:
% - Introduction
%   - discuss the dog category, its been little explored, link to human reconstruction (infants, overweight individuals)
%   - We also want to make it run real-time.
% - Related Work - focus on techniques which focus on challenging caetgories. Draw out the most similar work (kanazawa birds and zebras). For this work, we want to only deal with monocular input to extend applicability to multiple categories. "in-the-loop" methods.
% - Technical related work [AWF] - Methods for adapting priors, expectation maximization etc.
% - StanfordExtra - since in this paper we want high fidelity reconstructions for one category, it is economical to collect training data for it. 
% - SMBLD - Design of a realistic dog template model. Possibly run SMAL optimizer using this SMBLD model and compare with previous paper. While better, there is still room for improvement.
% - Expectation maximization in the loop.
% - End-to-end deep learning approach. Architecture etc.
% - Experimentation. 


% Possible Additional Experiments
% (1) Add a model fitting stage
% (2) Add texture
% (3) In theory could also run on horses, but would take time.
