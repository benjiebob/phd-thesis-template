\subsection{SPIN collaboration between DL and OPT}
%Using this strategy, SPIN demonstrates a successful collaboration of two core model fitting paradigms: regression-based deep neural networks and iterative optimization (often referred to as energy-based methods). Optimization methods typically achieve highly accurate alignment between the 3D template model and input image data. However, they are often slow nad suffer greatly if the 3D template model is poorly initialized. In contrast, deep learning methods which directly regress 3D model parameters require large training datasets and, while previous methods~\lazycite{HMR}{HMR} show good results, they are not pixel accurate to the input image. they are not pixel accurate. The insight realised by SPIN is a pixel-accurate fit achieved by an iterative process can act as a strong supervisory signal for a deep network during its training phase. In addition, deep networks can be used to generate high quality initializations for the optimization phase. Critically, SPIN only relies on the slow energy minimization procedure to generate the supervisory signal during the network's training loop, so the test-time performance is unaffected.
