\section{3D Skeleton Prediction}





\subsection{More stuff}
There is an extensive body of prior work related to joint position prediction for human subjects. Earlier work used graphical approaches such as pictorial structure models~\cite{andriluka2010monocular,pishchulin2013poselet,johnson2010clustered}, which have since been replaced with deep learning-based methods~\cite{cao2017realtime,bulat2016human}. Few works predict animal joint positions directly owing to the lack of annotated data, although Mathis {\em et al.}~\cite{mathis2018deeplabcut} demonstrate the effectiveness of human pose estimation architectures for restricted animal domains. Our method instead trains on silhouette input, allowing the use of synthetic training imagery. The related task of animal part segmentation~\cite{wang2015joint,wang2015semantic} has seen some progress due to general object part datasets~\cite{chen_cvpr14,zhou2017scene}.
