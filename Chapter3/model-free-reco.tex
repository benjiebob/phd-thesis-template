\subsection{Shape-from-X}

\subsubsection*{Shape from silhouette.} Silhouette images have been shown to contain sufficient shape information to enable their use in many 3D recovery pipelines. Chen {\em et al.}~\cite{chen2010inferring} demonstrate single-view shape reconstruction from such input for general object classes, by building a shape space model from 3D samples. More related to our work, Favreau {\em et al.}~\cite{favreau2004animal} apply PCA to silhouette images to extract animal gaits from video sequences. The task of predicting silhouette images from 2D input has been effectively used as a proxy for regressing 3D model parameters for humans~\cite{tan17indirect,kanazawa18end-to-end} and other 3D objects~\cite{wiles2017silnet}.
