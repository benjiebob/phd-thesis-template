	abstract = {A major difficulty for 3D human body tracking from monocular image sequences is the near non-observability of kinematic degrees of freedom that generate motion in depth. For known link (body segment) lengths, the strict non-observabilities reduce to twofold 'forwards/ backwards flipping' ambiguities for each link. These imply 2 # links formal inverse kinematics solutions for the full model, and hence linked groups of O(2 # links) local minima in the model-image matching cost function. Choosing the wrong minimum leads to rapid mistracking, so for reliable tracking, rapid methods of investigating alternative minima within a group are needed. Previous approaches to this have used generic search methods that do not exploit the specific problem structure. Here, we complement these by using simple kinematic reasoning to enumerate the tree of possible forwards/ backwards flips, thus greatly speeding the search within each linked group of minima. Our methods can be used either deterministically, or within stochastic 'jump-diffusion' style search processes. We give experimental results on some challenging monocular human tracking sequences, showing how the new kinematic-flipping based sampling method improves and complements existing ones.},

	abstract = {A probabilistic method for tracking 3D articulated human figures in monocular image sequences is presented. Within a Bayesian framework, we define a generative model of image appearance, a robust likelihood function based on image graylevel differences, and a prior probability distribution over pose and joint angles that models how humans move. The posterior probability distribution over model parameters is represented using a discrete set of samples and is propagated over time using particle filtering. The approach extends previous work on parameterized optical flow estimation to exploit a complex 3D articulated motion model. It also extends previous work on human motion tracking by including a perspective camera model, by modeling limb self occlusion, and by recovering 3D motion from a monocular sequence. The explicit posterior probability distribution represents ambiguities due to image matching, model singularities, and perspective projection. The method relies only on a frame-to-frame assumption of brightness constancy and hence is able to track people under changing viewpoints, in grayscale image sequences, and with complex unknown backgrounds.},

  abstract  = {We describe how to learn a compact and efficient model of the surface deformation of human hands. The model is built from a set of noisy depth images of a diverse set of subjects performing different poses with their hands. We represent the observed surface using Loop subdivision of a control mesh that is deformed by our learned parametric shape and pose model. The model simultaneously accounts for variation in subject-specific shape and subject-agnostic pose. Specifically, hand shape is parameterized as a linear combination of a mean mesh in a neutral pose with a small number of offset vectors. This mesh is then articulated using standard linear blend skinning (LBS) to generate the control mesh of a subdivision surface. We define an energy that encourages each depth pixel to be explained by our model, and the use of a smooth subdivision surface allows us to optimize for all parameters jointly from a rough initialization. The efficacy of our method is demonstrated using both synthetic and real data, where it is shown that hand shape variation can be represented using only a small number of basis components. We compare with other approaches including PCA and show a substantial improvement in the representational power of our model, while maintaining the efficiency of a linear shape basis.},
